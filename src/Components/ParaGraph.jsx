            When it comes to casual wear, men don’t necessarily have a lot of options. Women have a wide range of
            options in casual wear, whereas men are left with <span className="font-semibold">t-shirts</span> and{" "}
            <span className="font-semibold">casual shirts</span>. That’s about it, right? And for men who are not
            necessarily comfortable wearing crew neck t-shirts as a part of a casual ensemble, the options dwindle even
            further. That’s where men’s polo t-shirts come into the picture. For starters, men’s polo t-shirts have an
            unnecessarily incorrect connotation attached to them—that it is a garment only older men prefer. That is
            quite untrue. While older men have preferred the polo t-shirt most popularly, younger men are taking to it
            too, thanks to a variety of new styling options. Polo t-shirts for men can be a cool casual wear option. At{" "}

            <span className="font-semibold">denims</span> and look like slouchy and unkempt. Let’s introduce you to
            casual wear tailored shorts. Men’s polo t-shirts go really well with tailored shorts. Tuck them in, loop
            through a braided belt, and step into a smart pair of espadrilles, and you are ready for brunch or a lunch
            date. Or a hangout with your buddies and some golf clubs on a weekend maybe? Men’s polo t-shirts and{" "}
            <span className="font-semibold">shorts</span> are a perfect daytime ensemble. Next, you can also style them
            with stylish trousers in interesting textures. Choose linen pants, for example, and pair them with a bright

            What is crucial while shopping for men’s polo t-shirts online or at stores is to ensure that it fits you
            perfectly. Do not buy men’s polo t-shirts in a bigger size. They need to sit like second skin on your
            shoulders and chest for maximum impact. For guys who workout regularly, the polo t-shirt really flatters a
            toned torso. Also, it is important to remember that younger men don’t need to wear pastels when it comes to
            polos. Pick bright colors that stand out and make you look smart and cheerful. And you can also check out
            micro stripes or micro prints, or collars in contrasting colors. Polo t-shirts for men are not as boring as
            they used to be, and at Westside, we bring you the most stylish options always.
